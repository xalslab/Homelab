# Home server build

## Overview
Simple NAS / Media server made out of salvaged parts from around the house.

## Hardware
- CPU: intel i5-4670K
- MoBo: Z97 PC Mate
- RAM: 16GB DDR3
- Storage: something 480gb
- Case: Tracer X-ray
<!-- Check exact specs, it's embarrassing >:(  -->

## Notes
- No GPU installed so as to save on energy costs / reduce noise.
- Setup not permanent, waiting on parts to come, current setup is for learning.

## Software
- Windows 11 Home
- Jellyfin
- Syncthing

## What I've Achieved
- Succesfully set up a basic jellyfin server with remote 
access using DuckDNS and port-forwarding.
- Learned a bit about dynamic DNS and network routing.
- Successfully set up a system that allows me to 
sync files from my phone to the jellyfin server 
and make them be available for streaming with minimal effort.
- Learned a bit about automatic syncing.
- realized i should write my wifi router admin panel password 
down after changing it, and not waste 2-3 hours trying to find it. :DD

## Next Steps
- Wait for new hardware to arrive (Raspberry Pi 5 4GB, Argus One case, all the necessary bells and whistles).
- Experiment with VMs.
- Research virtual security measures, since i'm pretty sure this setup is HELLA unsafe.
- Learn basic linux and git commands by heart, tired of looking them up
